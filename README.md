## Overview

Giuliani is a multi-page marketing website for a high-end footwear brand specialising in dress shoes, loafers and premium leather products.

Built from the 
<a href="https://github.com/CodeStitchOfficial/Intermediate-Website-Kit-SASS">CodeStitch Intermediate Website Kit</a>,  
the base framework provided Eleventy’s templating, folder structure and build tooling.  
All **brand-facing design, content, and component customisation** were implemented by me.

This project focuses on:

- elegant, luxury-brand visual design  
- clean typography and high-contrast layouts  
- premium product presentation  
- responsive, polished user experience  

It allowed me to practice front-end craftsmanship inside a real SSG workflow (Eleventy + Nunjucks + SASS).

## What I Customised

While the kit provided the underlying technical setup, everything visible on the Giuliani site was redesigned and rebuilt to match the aesthetic of a luxury brand.

Specifically:

- Rebuilt page markup and structure throughout `src/content` and `src/_includes`  
- Designed a refined visual look using custom SASS (colour palette, spacing, typography, hover states)  
- Replaced all default “starter” content with Giuliani-specific branding, product sections and copywriting  
- Implemented hero, product features, brand story, CTA and layout sequences in a premium style  
- Tuned responsive breakpoints to create a smooth experience on mobile, tablet and desktop  
- Adjusted navigation and header/footer structure for a more upscale, minimalist feel  

This showcases my ability to take a template and turn it into a fully customised, branded site.
